# Neighborfoods

## Purpose and vision
Are you a busy professional who gets home late from work, a new parent, or busy chaperoning kids to soccer after you get back from work?
Or just interested in trying various cuisines, and getting to know your neighbors?

You have reached the right place! You can now buy lunch or dinner plates from your neighbors and have a home-cooked meal experience every day of your busy week, delivered to your place by the seller!

## Solution
You can just browse around for what your neighbors have to offer and make your selections by choosing the number of plates.

Also, if you happen to make extra lunch or dinner and want to show off your cooking skills, post details of your delicacies. Have your neighbors rave about it!

## Backend API routes
1. GET a list of all existing seller postings
    * /meals

2. POST a new meal with seller and meal information
    * /meals

3. POST - seller's meal count should get updated after some of them are bought
    * /meals/:meal_id/:buy_id

4. POST a new buyer with buyer's contact information
    * /buyers


## Frontend
For the buyer and seller forms, I have used redux-forms


## This is version 1
In version 2 of this application, I plan to implement:
* Application should send out email notification to buyer and  seller of a transaction

* Backend routes for updating, deleting buyer and seller information are also coded in and tested. These will be implemented at the front-end in a later version of this application.
